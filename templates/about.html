            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>HealthAI was created with a simple but powerful goal: to make healthcare more accessible and accurate through the power of artificial intelligence. Our system bridges the gap between patients and preliminary medical diagnosis, providing instant insights based on reported symptoms.</p>

                    <h3>Symptom Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Our advanced machine learning model analyzes patterns in hundreds of symptoms and their relationships to various conditions.</p>

                    <div class="step-number">2</div>
                    <h3>Disease Prediction</h3>
                    <p>Using a trained Logistic Regression model, the system predicts the most likely condition based on symptom combinations.</p>
